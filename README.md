# IC2 Forge Hammer

This is a simple mod for Fabric 1.19.3 that implements the Forge Hammer from IndustrialCraft 2. We are developing this mod as a trial of Minecraft Development
within RAT Media Group, as we are looking to move onto bigger things if development
of this mod turns out to be successful.
